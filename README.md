    * Hit the play button on the top left corner.

4. For Physical iPhone
    * Check Xcode and IOS versions match.
        -> If you head over to Xcode and go to About Xcode, you should see the version of your Xcode.
        -> So for Xcode version 12.2, you should have a physical device that is running 14.2. Go to your physical device, click the Settings and then General and About, then you can see your Software Version.
    * Add an Apple developer account.
        -> You can simply just use your free Apple ID.
        -> Go into Xcode and click on Preferences. Then here, you should be able to add a Apple ID by clicking on the Add button, select Apple ID. Enter your Apple ID which is usually an e-mail and then your password. Once you've successfully logged in, you should be able to see your app ID show up right here inside.

        -> Target selected, and then head over to Signing & Capabilities tab and make sure that the Automatically managed signing checkbox is checked.
        -> Click on the Team dropdown list and then select the account that you've added just now.
        -> Once you've selected your team, all the errors on this page should go away.
        -> But if it does not and you see an error that says Fail to create Provisioning profile, then it might be because you haven't got your device connected using a USB cable. 
    * Connect physical device.
        -> Grab your USB cable and connect your physical device, your iPhone or your iPad to your Mac.
    * Trust yourself.
        -> You might see a pop up show up on your phone which asked you whther if you trust this computer. So go ahead and tap on the Trust button and it might also require you to type in the phone device passkey and follow the on-screen instructions to complete that process.
    * Build and run your app. 
        -> Go back to Xcode, click on the top bar here and select your physical phone as the device that you want to run your app onto.
        -> Now you might get a warning here saying something like device IOS version lower than deployment target. You need to update your iPhone to the latest version of IOS(14.2)
